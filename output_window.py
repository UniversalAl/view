#Python 3
"""
    named errorwindow originally
    Import this module into graphical Python apps to provide a
    sys.stderr. No functions to call, just import it. It uses
    only facilities in the Python standard distribution.

    If nothing is ever written to stderr, then the module just
    sits there and stays out of your face. Upon write to stderr,
    it launches a new process, piping it error stream. The new
    process throws up a window showing the error messages.

   martineau - Modified to use subprocess.Popen instead of the os.popen
               which has been deprecated since Py 2.6. Changed so it
               redirects both stdout and stderr. Also inserted double quotes around paths
               in case they have embedded space characters in them, as
               they did on my Windows system.

               
   to use it with Preview() together with for openCV player within vapoursynth script:            
   -changed subprocess.Popen command to list instead of string , so it works under linux
   -added exception to catch window canceled by user and deleting pipe, so new window is automatically constructed again if needed,
   -added st.ScrolledText instead of Text
   -made sure that subprocess.Popen executable is python executable (or pythonw under windows),
    under windows, running it from Mystery Keeper's vsedit, sys.executable returned 'vsedit',
